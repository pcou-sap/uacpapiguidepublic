## HTML Search Widget

To use the search in your application, you can simply integrate a predefined widget.

You can configure the widget to searche in a specific deliverable, product, version, and language. As well, you can define the appearance of the search widget, for example, the number of results to be displayed on one page, or the label of the button which starts the search.

This demo implementatation shows you how you can configure and use the search widget: [https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/D032443/UAWidgets/searchwidget\_html\_demo/demo\_search.html](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/D032443/UAWidgets/searchwidget_html_demo/demo_search.html).
